# Route-finding-using-beam-search-algorithm
Beam Search is a type of heuristic search algorithm used in Artificial Intelligence. It helps to find a path from a starting point to a goal point by exploring only the most promising paths. Unlike normal search methods that check all possible routes, Beam Search keeps only a limited number of the best options at each step.
